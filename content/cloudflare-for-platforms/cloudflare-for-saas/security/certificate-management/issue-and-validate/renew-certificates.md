# Renew certificates

If you are using a proxied hostname, new certificates are automatically validated [via HTTP](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/http/).
 
If you need to use another validation method — for example, if you are using wildcard certificates or certificates with multiple SANs — you need to repeat the DCV process with your chosen method and share the tokens with your customer.
